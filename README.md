<!-- AI:start:what-it-does -->
This project provides a unified dashboard for managing and monitoring infrastructure components. It consolidates tools like status pages, public dashboards, builder dashboards, rate mirrors, mirror list proxies, and a binary pastebin into a single monorepo. It is designed for infrastructure operators and developers who need centralized visibility and control over distributed systems.
<!-- AI:end:what-it-does -->

## Architecture

<!-- AI:start:architecture -->
The `infra-dashboard` repository is a monorepo containing multiple Rust-based services for managing and displaying infrastructure status. Each service operates independently but interacts through shared APIs and configurations. Key components include:

- `statuspage`: Provides a status monitoring interface for infrastructure components.
- `public-dashboard`: Serves a public-facing dashboard for infrastructure metrics.
- `builder-dashboard`: Manages build-related data and displays build statuses.
- `rate-mirrors`: Handles mirror rate-limiting and performance metrics.
- `mirrorlist-proxy`: Acts as a proxy for mirror selection and redirection.
- `bin-pastebin`: Implements a pastebin service for sharing logs or text snippets.

Services communicate via HTTP APIs and share configuration through `.env` files. Docker Compose is used for local orchestration. The directory structure is as follows:

```plaintext
.
├── README.md
├── bin-pastebin/
├── builder-dashboard/
├── config.example.env
├── docker-compose.yml
├── mirrorlist-proxy/
├── public-dashboard/
├── rate-mirrors/
└── statuspage/
```

## Install

<!-- Add installation instructions here. This section is yours — the AI will not modify it. -->

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Interested-Deving-1896/infra-dashboard.git
cd infra-dashboard
```

## Usage

<!-- Add usage examples here. This section is yours — the AI will not modify it. -->

## Configuration


All org/distro-specific values live in `config/infra.toml`. See `config/infra.example.toml` for a full reference.

## CI

<!-- AI:start:ci -->
The repository uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The workflows are:

- **`build.yml`**: Builds and tests all Rust-based components. Runs on push and pull request events. No secrets required.
- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Validates the `docker-compose.yml` file and ensures all services can start. Runs on push events. No secrets required.
- **`lint.yml`**: Runs linters for Rust code and YAML files. Executes on push and pull request events. No secrets required.
- **`release.yml`**: Builds and publishes Docker images for all services to a container registry. Triggers on tagged commits. Requires the `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` secrets.

All workflows are defined in the `.github/workflows` directory.
